# ABBA – マネー、マネー、マネー

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I work all night, I work all day
to play the bills I have to pay
ain't it sad
And still there never
seems to be
a single penny left for me
that's too bad
In my dreams I have a plan
if l got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball
Money, money, money
must be fanny
in the rich man's world
Money, money, money
always sunny
in the rich man's world
Aha, aha
all the things I could do
if l had a little money
it's rich man's world
it's rich man's world
A man like that is hard to find
but I can't get him of my mind
ain't it sad
And if he happens to be free
I bet he wouldn't fancy me
that's too bad
So I must leave, I'll have to go
to Las Vegas or Monaco
and win a forturn in a game
my life will never be the same
Money, money, money
must be fanny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha, aha
all the things I could do
if I had a little money
it‘s a rich man's world
Money, money, money
must be fanny
in the rich man's world
Money, money, money
always sunny
In the rich man's world
Aha, aha
all the things I could do
if I had a little money
it's a rich man's world
it's a rich man's world
